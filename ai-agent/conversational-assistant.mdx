## 💬 How Conversations Work (Step-by-Step)

Our AI follows a **proven 3-step process** to turn your trading ideas into money-making strategies:

### 🎯 The Magic 3-Step Process

<Steps>
<Step title="🗣️ You Tell AI What You Want">
**Just talk normally about trading - AI figures out the rest!**

**What You Might Say:**
- *"I want to buy Tesla when it drops"*
- *"Alert me if Apple goes above $200"*
- *"Sell my Microsoft if it falls below $300"*
- *"I want to make money when Netflix goes up"*

**AI Understands:** Buy signals, sell signals, alerts, price levels, and your trading goals.
</Step>

<Step title="❓ AI Asks Smart Follow-Up Questions">
**The AI acts like your experienced trading buddy who wants to help you succeed:**

**Typical AI Questions:**
- *"How much money do you want to invest in this trade?"*
- *"Should I alert you or automatically place the order?"*
- *"What if the stock keeps dropping - want a safety stop?"*
- *"Are you looking for quick profits or long-term gains?"*

**Why AI Asks:** To make sure your strategy is complete and protects your money!
</Step>

<Step title="✅ Get Your Perfect Trading Strategy">
**AI presents your finalized strategy in crystal-clear language:**

*"Here's your bulletproof trading strategy: When Tesla drops to $200, I'll buy $1,000 worth using a limit order. If Tesla falls to $180, I'll sell to protect your money. If Tesla goes to $250, I'll sell to lock in profits. Sound good?"*

**You Simply Say:** *"Perfect, let's do it!"* ✨
</Step>
</Steps>

## 🎯 Real Conversation Examples

**See how easy it is to create profitable trading strategies through simple conversations:**

### 💰 Example 1: Quick Profit Strategy

<Accordion title="🚀 Making money on Tesla stock movement">
**👤 You:** *"I think Tesla is going to go up soon. I want to buy some when it reaches **$250**."*

**🤖 AI:** *"Great choice! Tesla has good momentum. A few questions: Should I automatically buy Tesla at $250, or just alert you when it hits that price? Also, how much do you want to invest?"*

**👤 You:** *"Alert me when it hits $250, and I want to put **$2,000** into this trade."*

**🤖 AI:** *"Perfect! I'll set up an alert for when Tesla reaches $250. What's your plan if Tesla keeps going up after you buy - should I automatically sell at a certain profit level? And do you want protection if it goes down instead?"*

**👤 You:** *"Sell if it goes to **$300** for profits, and sell if it drops to **$230** to limit losses."*

**🤖 AI:** *"Excellent strategy! Here's your complete plan: Alert you when Tesla hits $250. Buy $2,000 worth. Automatically sell at $300 for profits ($400 gain) or at $230 to limit losses. Ready to activate?"*

**👤 You:** *"Yes, let's do it!"*

**✅ Result:** Your automated Tesla profit strategy is now active!
