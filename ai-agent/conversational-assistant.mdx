## 💬 Conversation Flow

The AI agent uses a structured approach to ensure strategy completeness:

### 📋 Information Gathering Phase

<Steps>
<Step title="🎯 Understand Your Intent">
The AI analyzes your input to identify:

- **Trading Actions**: Buy, sell, alert, start/stop strategies
- **Market Conditions**: Price levels, technical indicators, volume thresholds  
- **Order Types**: Market orders, limit orders, stop orders, trailing stops
- **Risk Parameters**: Position sizing, stop losses, take profits
</Step>

<Step title="❓ Ask Clarifying Questions">
If information is missing, the AI will prompt you:

**Example Questions:**
- *"What price level should trigger this action?"*
- *"What's your risk tolerance - conservative, moderate, or aggressive?"*
- *"Should this be a limit order or market order?"*
- *"How much capital do you want to allocate to this strategy?"*
</Step>

<Step title="✅ Validate and Confirm">
The AI presents your complete strategy and asks for explicit confirmation:

*"Here's your refined strategy: [Plain language description]. Is this exactly what you want? Please confirm this is correct before I finalize it."*
</Step>
</Steps>

## 🎨 Example Conversations

### 🔧 Strategy Refinement Example

<Accordion title="💬 Refining an Existing Strategy">
**👤 User:** *"Alert me when **TSLA**'s price reaches **$250**, and place a limit buy order at **$245**."*

**🤖 AI Agent:** 
```json
{
  "Handover": "No",
  "message": "I understand you want to be alerted when TSLA reaches $250 and place a limit buy order at $245. Should these actions happen simultaneously when the price hits $250, or do you want the limit order placed separately?",
  "final_strategy": ""
}
```

**👤 User:** *"Yes, both should happen when the price reaches **$250**."*

**🤖 AI Agent:** 
```json
{
  "Handover": "No", 
  "message": "Perfect! Here's your refined strategy: 'Alert me when the current price of TSLA equals $250.00. Place a limit buy order for TSLA at $245.00 when this happens.' Is this exactly what you want? Please confirm before I finalize it.",
  "final_strategy": ""
}
```

**👤 User:** *"Yes, that's perfect!"*

**🤖 AI Agent:**
```json
{
  "Handover": "Yes",
  "message": "Your strategy has been confirmed and is ready to be implemented.",
  "final_strategy": "Alert me when the current price of TSLA equals $250.00. Place a limit buy order for TSLA at $245.00 when this happens."
}
```
</Accordion>

### 🎯 Strategy Creation Example

<Accordion title="💡 Creating a New Strategy">
**👤 User:** *"I want a medium-term growth strategy for tech stocks. I have **$50k** and moderate risk tolerance."*

**🤖 AI Agent:**
```json
{
  "Handover": "No",
  "message": "I'd be happy to help create a medium-term growth strategy for tech stocks! To better tailor this: 1) What specific tech stocks interest you, or would you like suggestions? 2) What timeframe is 'medium-term' for you? 3) Any preferred technical indicators?",
  "final_strategy": ""
}
```

**👤 User:** *"I like **AAPL** and **MSFT**, medium-term is about 1 year, and I prefer using **RSI**."*

**🤖 AI Agent:**
```json
{
  "Handover": "No",
  "message": "Excellent! Here's a potential strategy: 'Focus on AAPL and MSFT for 1-year growth with moderate risk tolerance. Set alerts when 14-day RSI for either stock falls below 30 (oversold conditions = buying opportunities). Allocate $25k each to AAPL and MSFT with 5% position sizing.' Does this align with your goals?",
  "final_strategy": ""
}
```

**👤 User:** *"Perfect! Let's do it."*

**🤖 AI Agent:**
```json
{
  "Handover": "Yes",
  "message": "Your strategy has been confirmed and is ready to be implemented.",
  "final_strategy": "Focus on AAPL and MSFT for 1-year growth with moderate risk tolerance. Set alerts when 14-day RSI for either stock falls below 30 (oversold conditions = buying opportunities). Allocate $25k each to AAPL and MSFT with 5% position sizing."

## 🔄 Conversation Patterns

### 🎯 Pattern 1: Quick Strategy Setup

```
👤 "Buy AAPL at $150, sell at $180, stop loss at $140"
🤖 "I'll set up limit orders for AAPL: buy at $150, sell at $180, stop at $140. What position size?"

```

```

### 📊 Pattern 3: Complex Multi-Condition

```
👤 "Alert me when TSLA RSI is oversold AND volume is above average"

## 🚀 Advanced AI Features

### 🎯 Strategy Suggestions

The AI can **proactively suggest** strategy improvements:

- **📈 Risk-Adjusted Position Sizing**: *"Consider using 2% risk per trade for better risk management"*
- **🔄 Multiple Timeframe Confirmation**: *"Would you like to add a weekly trend filter for better entry timing?"*
- **🛡️ Additional Risk Controls**: *"Should I add a maximum drawdown limit to protect your capital?"*
