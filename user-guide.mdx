### View a Run Report
1. Open **Strategies**
2. Select a strategy → **View Runs**
3. Choose a run → **Download Run Report**

# 6. Technical Overview (For Developers & Advanced Users)

The Technical Overview provides insight into the data models, database design, and external services that power eZorro.

## 6.1 Strategy Data Models

eZorro uses several internal models to store, execute, and report on strategies:

### Strategy Model
Holds all information about a user's trading strategy — including title, rules, summary, structured details, and linked backtest or report results.

### Schedule Model
Defines how often a strategy should run (for example, every 5 minutes, hourly, or daily) along with start/end times or optional date ranges.

### Run Model
Stores the results of each live execution of a strategy. It records when the run occurred, the outcomes, and performance data.

### Report Model
Links strategies to their reports, storing references to performance documents and results that can be downloaded by users.

### Backtest Result Model
Contains the outcomes of simulations run on historical market data, including return percentages, drawdowns, Sharpe Ratio, win rate, and performance charts.

## 6.2 Database Relationships

* A **User** can have multiple **Strategies**
* Each **Strategy** can have multiple **Schedules**, **Runs**, and **Reports**
* **Backtest Results** link directly to a **Strategy**
* **Reports** may reference both backtests and runs

## 6.3 Service Integrations

* **Polygon.io** – Market and fundamentals
* **QuiverQuant** – Alternative datasets
* **Alpaca** – Brokerage integration for execution
* **SnapTrade** – Secure account linking/sync
* **Firebase** – Chat sessions, logs
* **TimescaleDB** – Time-series storage
* **Render** – Hosting and cron-based schedulers

## 6.4 Execution Workflow (High-Level)

1. User creates/refines a strategy via the AI Assistant
2. Strategy saved with structured parameters
3. If automation is enabled, a scheduler checks and triggers active strategies
4. During each run:
   * Market data is fetched (e.g., Polygon, QuiverQuant)
   * If linked, trades may be routed via Alpaca or SnapTrade
   * Results are recorded and attached to reports
5. Backtests follow similar logic but use historical data instead of live feeds
