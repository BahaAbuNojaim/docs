# 4. Automation & Scheduling

Automation in eZorro allows you to set strategies on autopilot. Instead of manually running checks, you can define how often a strategy should be evaluated, and eZorro will execute it at the specified intervals.

## Setting Frequency

You can assign a frequency to each strategy to control how often it runs.

1. Go to the **Strategies Page**.
2. Select the strategy you want to automate.
3. Click **Add Frequency / Schedule**.
4. In the Scheduling Popup:
   - **Repeat Interval**: Choose from 1 min, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, or Daily.
   - **Start Time**: Run immediately or at a specific time.
   - **End Time**: Never (continuous) or set a stop time.
   - **Date Range (optional)**: Limit the automation to specific dates.
5. Click **Save Schedule**.

**Example**: "Run Tesla RSI strategy every 15 minutes between 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, weekdays only."

## Start / Stop Strategies

You have full control over running strategies:
- **Start** ▶️ – Activates strategy evaluation on the chosen schedule.
- **Pause** ⏸️ – Temporarily suspends execution (can resume later).
- **Stop** ⏹️ – Ends execution entirely until restarted.

<Note>Only strategy owners can start/stop their strategies.</Note>

## Cron Job-Based Execution (Technical Workflow)

Behind the scenes, eZorro uses a cron job system to check which strategies need to be executed.

### How it Works:
1. **Cron Job Runs**: Every minute/hour, depending on configuration.
2. **Check Schedules**: Looks at all saved schedules in the database.
3. **Filter Active Strategies**: Validates interval, start/end time, and date range.
4. **Trigger Evaluation**: Sends a request to the evaluation engine for each active strategy.
5. **Run Results**: Performance metrics and triggered alerts are saved and displayed to the user.

### Advantages of Cron Job Scheduling:
- **Efficient** – only executes active schedules.
- **Scalable** – supports thousands of strategies without overload.
- **Flexible** – works with various intervals and user-defined conditions.

## Use Cases for Automation

- **Short-Term Trading**: Run momentum strategies every 1 or 5 minutes.
- **Swing Trading**: Run strategies once per hour or daily.
- **Event-Based Monitoring**: Run strategies only during market hours or specific dates (e.g., earnings week)

# 5. Reports & Analytics

The Reports & Analytics section allows you to track, validate, and optimize your strategies. eZorro provides three types of reports: Backtest Reports, Run Reports, and Strategy Reports. Each report includes performance metrics, visualizations, and actionable insights.

## 5.1 Backtest Reports

Backtest Reports show how a strategy would have performed using historical market data. This helps you test ideas before committing real capital.

### How to Generate a Backtest Report:
1. Open the **Strategies Page**.
2. Select a strategy.
3. Click **Run Backtest**.

## 5.2 Run Reports

Run Reports are generated each time a strategy executes during live or scheduled trading. They allow you to track real-world performance over time.

### How to View a Run Report:
1. Open the **Strategies Page**.
2. Select a strategy → click **View Runs**.
3. Choose a run from the list → click **Download Run Report**.

### What's Included:
- **Run Overview**: Execution time, market conditions at run.
- **Performance Metrics**: ROI, win rate, number of trades, profit factor.
- **Trade Analysis**: Entry & exit prices, position sizes, triggered alerts.

## 5.3 Strategy Reports

Strategy Reports provide a comprehensive summary of an entire strategy, combining both backtest and run data into one document.

### How to Download a Strategy Report:

2. Select a strategy.
3. Click **Download Strategy Report**.

### What's Included:

# 6. Technical Overview (For Developers & Advanced Users)

The Technical Overview provides insight into the data models, database design, and external services that power eZorro.

## 6.1 Strategy Data Models

eZorro uses several internal models to store, execute, and report on strategies:

### Strategy Model
Holds all information about a user's trading strategy — including title, rules, summary, structured details, and linked backtest or report results.

### Schedule Model
Defines how often a strategy should run (for example, every 5 minutes, hourly, or daily) along with start/end times or optional date ranges.

### Run Model
Stores the results of each live execution of a strategy. It records when the run occurred, the outcomes, and performance data.

### Report Model
Links strategies to their reports, storing references to performance documents and results that can be downloaded by users.

### Backtest Result Model
Contains the outcomes of simulations run on historical market data, including return percentages, drawdowns, Sharpe Ratio, win rate, and performance charts.

## 6.2 Database Relationships

The data models are connected in the following way:
- A **User** can have multiple **Strategies**.
- Each **Strategy** can have multiple **Schedules**, **Runs**, and **Reports**.
- **Backtest Results** are tied directly to a strategy.
- **Reports** may reference both backtest results and live runs.

## 6.3 Service Integrations

eZorro relies on integrations with multiple external providers to deliver real-time data, execution, and secure account management:

- **Polygon.io** – Provides stock market and fundamental data.
- **QuiverQuant** – Supplies alternative datasets, including social sentiment and unusual market activity.
- **Alpaca** – Brokerage integration for executing stock and crypto trades.
- **SnapTrade** – Securely connects and syncs user brokerage accounts with eZorro.
- **Firebase** – Stores unstructured data such as chat sessions and logs.
- **TimescaleDB** – Manages time-series data like stock/crypto price history and portfolio trends.
- **Render** – Hosts services and handles scheduled task execution through cron jobs.

## 6.4 Execution Workflow (High-Level)

1. The user creates or refines a strategy through the AI Assistant.
2. The strategy is saved in the database with its parameters.
3. If automation is enabled, a cron job regularly checks schedules and triggers active strategies.
4. During each run:
   - Market data is fetched from Polygon.io and QuiverQuant.
   - If linked, trades are executed via Alpaca or SnapTrade.
   - Results are logged into the system and linked to reports.
5. When backtesting, the same flow is used but relies on historical data instead of live market feeds.
