Backtesting helps evaluate how a strategy could have behaved in the past. eZorro's advanced backtesting uses historical data and trading cost assumptions to provide realistic insights into potential performance.

## How Backtesting Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Historical Data Testing">
    Run your strategy on 3–5 years of market data to see how it might have behaved across different conditions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trading Cost Simulation">
    Factor in commissions, slippage, and market impact to approximate realistic execution.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Performance Review">
    Review metrics such as total return, win rate, maximum drawdown, and risk-adjusted outcomes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Interpreting Results

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Strengths">
    Look for strategies that perform reasonably across different years and market conditions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Spot Red Flags">
    Be cautious of strategies that only perform in one type of market, have very large drawdowns, or rely on very few trades.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Condition Testing">
    Evaluate how your strategy behaves in bull, bear, and sideways markets to understand potential robustness.
  </Step>
</Steps>
