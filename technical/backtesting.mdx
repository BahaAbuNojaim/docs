**Never risk your money on untested strategies again.** eZorro's advanced backtesting shows exactly how your strategy would have performed using real historical data.

## What Makes eZorro Backtesting Special?

Unlike simple backtesting tools, eZorro includes all the real-world factors that affect your returns.

### Realistic Trading Conditions

**We Include Everything That Costs Money**:

✅ **Commission Costs** - Your actual broker fees
✅ **Slippage** - The difference between expected and actual prices  
✅ **Market Impact** - How your trades affect stock prices
✅ **Liquidity Limits** - You can't always buy/sell unlimited shares

**Why This Matters**: Other backtesting tools show fantasy results. eZorro shows what you'd actually make.

<Card title="Real Example: Strategy Reality Check" icon="chart-line">
**Simple Backtest**: "Strategy made 45% last year"

**eZorro Realistic Backtest**: "Strategy made 32% after all costs"

**The 13% difference**: Commission, slippage, and realistic execution costs
</Card>

### Data Quality That Matters

eZorro uses the highest quality data to give you accurate results:

<Steps>
<Step title="No Survivorship Bias">
**The Problem**: Most backtests only use stocks that are still trading today, ignoring companies that went bankrupt.

**eZorro Solution**: We include ALL stocks that existed during your test period, including the failures.

**Why Important**: This prevents inflated returns from only seeing the winners.
</Step>

<Step title="Corporate Actions Included">
**Stock Splits & Dividends Handled**: When Apple splits 2-for-1, we automatically adjust all historical prices.

**Spin-offs Tracked**: When companies split into separate companies, we track both.

**Mergers & Acquisitions**: Handles when companies get bought out.
</Step>

<Step title="Real-Time Data Simulation">
**No Future Peeking**: Our backtest only uses information that was actually available on each trading day.

**Example**: If testing a strategy on January 1, 2020, we only use earnings reports published before that date.

**Result**: Prevents unrealistic "crystal ball" backtests.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Testing That Pros Use

eZorro automatically runs sophisticated tests that hedge funds pay millions to develop.

### Walk-Forward Testing

**How It Works**: Instead of testing on all historical data at once, eZorro tests your strategy period by period, just like real trading.

**Process**:
1. Use 1 year of data to optimize strategy
2. Test next 3 months with those settings
3. Re-optimize with new year of data
4. Test next 3 months again
5. Repeat through entire history

**Why Better**: Shows if your strategy adapts to changing markets or just got lucky once.

<Card title="Walk-Forward Results Example" icon="chart-mixed">
**Consistent Strategy**:
- Q1 2020: +8.5%
- Q2 2020: +6.2%
- Q3 2020: +7.1%
- Q4 2020: +9.3%

**Over-Optimized Strategy**:
- Q1 2020: +45% (got lucky)
- Q2 2020: -12% (failed)
- Q3 2020: -8% (failed)
- Q4 2020: +2% (barely worked)
</Card>

### Monte Carlo Testing

**What It Does**: Runs your strategy 1,000+ times with different random scenarios to see all possible outcomes.

**Shows You**:
- Best case scenario
- Worst case scenario  
- Most likely outcomes
- Probability of losing money
- How bad drawdowns could get

**Real Example**: 
- 85% chance of making money
- Expected return: 18% annually
- Worst case: -22% in bad year
- 95% confidence: Between +8% and +28%

## Real Market Conditions Included

### Transaction Costs That Matter

**Dynamic Commission Structure**:
- Small trades ($0-$1,000): Higher percentage fees
- Medium trades ($1,000-$10,000): Standard broker rates  
- Large trades ($10,000+): Negotiated lower rates
- High-volume traders: Automatic discounts

**Market Impact Modeling**: 
When you buy 10,000 shares, the price moves up slightly. eZorro calculates this "slippage" based on:
- How much you're buying vs daily volume
- Current market volatility
- Time of day and liquidity

<Tip>
**Real Example**: Buying $50,000 of a small-cap stock might increase your purchase price by 0.3%, while buying $50,000 of Apple might only increase it by 0.05%.
</Tip>

### Liquidity Reality Check

**You Can't Always Trade What You Want**: 
- Can't buy $1 million of a penny stock in one day
- Large orders get spread across multiple days
- Some stocks have trading halts
- After-hours trading has wider spreads

**eZorro Handles This**: Automatically splits large orders and shows realistic execution timeline.

## Avoiding The "Backtest Trap"

### Out-of-Sample Testing

**The Problem**: Most strategies look amazing when tested on the same data used to create them.

**eZorro Solution**: 
1. **Training Period**: Use 70% of data to develop strategy
2. **Testing Period**: Test on completely unused 30% of data
3. **Reality Check**: Compare results between both periods

**What Good Results Look Like**:
- Training period: 22% returns
- Testing period: 18% returns
- **Conclusion**: Strategy is robust

**Red Flags**:
- Training period: 45% returns  
- Testing period: 8% returns
- **Conclusion**: Over-optimized, won't work in real life

### Multiple Time Period Validation

**Time Series Cross-Validation**: Tests your strategy across multiple time periods to ensure consistency.

**Process**:
- Test 1: Train on 2018-2019, test on 2020
- Test 2: Train on 2018-2020, test on 2021  
- Test 3: Train on 2018-2021, test on 2022
- Test 4: Train on 2018-2022, test on 2023
- Test 5: Train on 2018-2023, test on 2024

**Gives You**: Confidence that strategy works across different market conditions.

## Common Backtesting Mistakes (That eZorro Avoids)

<Warning>
**Expensive Backtesting Errors**:

1. **Crystal Ball Problem**: Using tomorrow's news to make today's trades
2. **Survivor Bias**: Only testing on companies that didn't go bankrupt
3. **Over-Optimization**: Making strategy perfect for past data (but terrible for future)
4. **Ignoring Costs**: Forgetting commissions, slippage, and taxes
5. **Unlimited Money Myth**: Assuming you can buy unlimited shares instantly
6. **One-Trick Pony**: Only testing in bull markets
