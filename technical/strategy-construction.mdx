  <Step title="Backtesting">
    Test your strategy on historical data to see how it would have performed over the past 3-5 years.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Performance Analysis">
    Review key metrics: win rate, average return, maximum drawdown, and risk-adjusted returns.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Market Condition Testing">
    Verify your strategy works in different market environments: bull markets, bear markets, and sideways periods.
  </Step>
</Steps>
