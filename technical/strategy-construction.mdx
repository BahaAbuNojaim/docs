**Turn your trading ideas into automated strategies** that work 24/7. Tell eZorro AI what you want in plain English and watch it build professional-grade strategies for you.

## The 3-Step Strategy Building Process

Professional traders use this proven framework. Now it's yours - simplified for everyday investors.

### Step 1: Define Your Trading Idea

<Steps>
<Step title="Start with What You Know">
The best strategies come from simple observations:

- **Trend Following**: "Stocks making new highs tend to go higher"
- **Mean Reversion**: "Quality stocks bounce back after temporary dips"  
- **Momentum**: "Good earnings announcements lead to continued gains"
- **Pairs Trading**: "Coca-Cola and Pepsi prices stay in balance"

**Tell eZorro AI your observation in plain English!**
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Your Market Conditions">
Decide when your strategy should trade:

**Bull Markets**: "Only trade when market is above 200-day average"
**Bear Markets**: "Focus on defensive stocks and short positions"
**Sideways Markets**: "Buy oversold, sell overbought within range"
**High Volatility**: "Reduce position sizes and widen stops"

**Example to eZorro AI**: 
*"Only execute this strategy when SPY is in an uptrend"*
</Step>

<Step title="Pick What to Trade">
Keep it simple - start with what you understand:

- **Single Stock**: Master one before adding more (Apple, Microsoft)
- **ETF Sectors**: Trade entire sectors (Technology, Healthcare)
- **Index Funds**: Trade the whole market (SPY, QQQ)
- **Popular Pairs**: Trade relationships (Gold vs Silver)

**Tell eZorro AI**: 
*"Trade only large-cap tech stocks with over $1 million daily volume"*
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Buy and Sell Rules

Turn your idea into clear rules that eZorro AI can automate.

#### When to Buy (Entry Signals)

**Trend Following Example**:
*"Buy when the 20-day moving average crosses above the 50-day moving average AND volume is 20% above average"*

**Mean Reversion Example**:
*"Buy when RSI drops below 30 AND price touches the lower Bollinger Band AND the stock is still above its 100-day average"*

**Breakout Example**:
*"Buy when stock breaks above its 20-day high with 50% more volume than usual"*

<Card title="Pro Tip: Combine Multiple Signals" icon="lightbulb">
The best strategies use 2-3 confirming signals. This reduces false entries and increases win rate from 50% to 70%+
</Card>

#### When to Sell (Exit Signals)

**Profit Taking Rules**:
- "Take profits when gain reaches 10%"
- "Sell half at 5% gain, trail the rest"
- "Exit when RSI hits 70 (overbought)"

**Stop Loss Rules**:
- "Cut losses at 3% below entry"
- "Use 2x ATR for dynamic stops"
- "Trail stop 5% below highest price"

**Time-Based Rules**:
- "Close all positions after 10 days"
- "Exit before earnings announcements"
- "Sell if no profit after 5 days"

**Tell eZorro AI your complete exit plan**: 
*"Set stop loss at 3%. Take half profits at 5% gain. Trail remaining position with 5% stop."*

### Step 3: Add Safety Controls

Protect your capital with professional risk management - all automated.

#### Position Sizing (How Much to Buy)

**The 2% Rule**: Never risk more than 2% of your account per trade

**Tell eZorro AI one of these**:
- *"Risk 1% of my account on each trade"* (Conservative)
- *"Risk 2% per trade with maximum 5 positions"* (Moderate)
- *"Adjust position size based on volatility"* (Advanced)

<Tip>
**Example**: With $10,000 account and 1% risk:
- Stock price: $100
- Stop loss: $97 (3% below)
- Risk per share: $3
- Position size: $100 ÷ $3 = 33 shares
- Total investment: $3,300 (33% of account)
</Tip>

#### Portfolio Protection Rules

**Diversification Controls**:
- "Maximum 5 positions at once"
- "No more than 20% in any sector"
- "Don't buy similar stocks together"

**Daily Loss Limits**:
- "Stop trading if down 3% in one day"
- "Reduce position sizes after 2 losing trades"
- "Alert me if portfolio drops 10% from peak"

**Tell eZorro AI your safety rules**: 
*"Never have more than 6% total risk across all positions. Maximum 20% per sector. Stop trading after 3% daily loss."*
