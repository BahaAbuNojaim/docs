Transform market data into profitable trading signals using proven technical indicators. eZorro AI allows you to implement these indicators using simple English commands.

## Essential Trading Indicators

Professional traders rely on these time-tested indicators to make profitable decisions. These indicators can now be automated through eZorro's platform.

### Moving Averages

Moving averages show the average stock price over a specific time period, smoothing out daily noise to reveal underlying trends.

**Types of Moving Averages**

Simple Moving Average (SMA):
- 20-day SMA: Short-term trend (1 month)
- 50-day SMA: Medium-term trend (2.5 months)
- 200-day SMA: Long-term trend (10 months)

Exponential Moving Average (EMA):
- Reacts faster to recent price changes
- Better suited for short-term trading
- Common periods: 12-day and 26-day

**Trading with Moving Averages**

- Golden Cross: 50-day crosses above 200-day indicates major buy signal
- Death Cross: 50-day crosses below 200-day indicates major sell signal
- Price above MA confirms uptrend
- Price below MA confirms downtrend

Example strategy: "Buy stocks when their 20-day moving average crosses above the 50-day moving average. Sell when it crosses below." This approach typically achieves a 65-70% success rate in trending markets.

### RSI - Relative Strength Index

RSI indicates whether a stock is overbought or oversold on a scale of 0-100.

**Key RSI Levels**

- Above 70: Overbought (potential sell signal)
- Below 30: Oversold (potential buy signal)
- 50 Level: Neutral zone

**RSI Trading Strategies**

Oversold Bounce:
- Wait for RSI below 30
- Buy when RSI turns up
- Sell when RSI reaches 50-60

Divergence Trading:
- Stock makes new high but RSI doesn't: Sell signal
- Stock makes new low but RSI doesn't: Buy signal

Note: RSI works best in ranging markets. In strong trends, consider using 80/20 levels instead of 70/30.

### MACD - Moving Average Convergence Divergence

MACD shows the relationship between two moving averages, revealing momentum changes.

**MACD Components**

- MACD Line: 12-day EMA minus 26-day EMA
- Signal Line: 9-day EMA of MACD line
- Histogram: Distance between MACD and Signal lines

**Trading Signals**

- Bullish: MACD crosses above Signal line
- Bearish: MACD crosses below Signal line
- Strong Trend: Lines far apart
- Trend Weakening: Lines converging

Example implementation: "Buy when MACD turns bullish and sell when it turns bearish. Only trade when histogram is expanding."

### Bollinger Bands

Bollinger Bands provide dynamic support and resistance levels based on volatility.

**Band Components**

- Middle Band: 20-day moving average
- Upper Band: Middle + (2 × standard deviation)
- Lower Band: Middle - (2 × standard deviation)

**Trading Strategies**

Mean Reversion:
- Buy when price touches lower band
- Sell when price reaches middle or upper band
- Most effective in sideways markets

Breakout Trading:
- Buy when price breaks above upper band with volume
- Indicates start of strong trend
- Set stop below middle band

Important: 95% of price action occurs within the bands. Moves outside bands are significant events.

## Advanced Indicators

### Stochastic Oscillator

Shows where current price sits relative to recent price range.

**Key Levels**

- Above 80: Overbought zone
- Below 20: Oversold zone
- 50: Neutral momentum

Best used in combination with RSI for confirmation of oversold/overbought conditions.

### Average True Range (ATR)

ATR measures market volatility by showing how much a stock typically moves.

**ATR Applications**

- Position Sizing: Use smaller positions in volatile stocks
- Stop Loss Placement: Set stops at 2× ATR from entry
- Profit Targets: Target gains of 3× ATR

Example usage: "Use ATR to set stop losses. Place stops 2 ATR below entry price."

### Volume Indicators

**On-Balance Volume (OBV)**
- Rising OBV + Rising Price: Healthy uptrend
- Falling OBV + Rising Price: Weak rally (sell signal)

**Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)**
- Price above VWAP: Bullish
- Price below VWAP: Bearish
- Institutions use VWAP as fair value reference

## Combining Indicators for Maximum Effectiveness

The most profitable strategies combine multiple indicators for confirmation.

### Triple Confirmation Strategy

**Requirements for Buy Signal**

1. Price above 50-day moving average (trend confirmation)
2. RSI between 40-60 (not overbought)
3. MACD turning bullish (momentum confirmation)

Implementation: "Only buy when price is above 50-day MA, RSI is below 60, and MACD is bullish. Use 2% position size."

**Expected Performance**
- Win Rate: 75-80%
- Average Gain: 8-12% per trade
- Fewer trades but higher quality

### Volatility Breakout System

**Combines**
- Bollinger Bands (volatility)
- Volume (confirmation)
- ATR (position sizing)

Implementation: "Buy when price breaks above Bollinger Bands with 2× average volume. Size positions based on ATR. Trail stop at lower band."

## Indicator Settings for Different Markets

### Trending Markets

**Best Indicators**
- Moving Average Crossovers
- MACD
- ADX (Above 25 confirms trend)

**Settings**: Use longer periods (50/200 MA instead of 20/50)

### Ranging Markets

**Best Indicators**
- RSI
- Stochastic
- Bollinger Bands

**Settings**: Use standard periods (14-day RSI, 20-day Bollinger)

### Volatile Markets

**Best Indicators**
- ATR for risk management
- Bollinger Bands (widen in volatility)
- Volume indicators

**Settings**: Shorter periods for faster reaction

## Common Indicator Mistakes to Avoid

**Expensive Trading Mistakes**

1. Using too many indicators - More isn't better, 3-4 maximum
2. Ignoring the trend - Don't buy oversold in downtrends
3. Not waiting for confirmation - One indicator alone isn't enough
4. Wrong timeframe - Day trading with monthly indicators fails
5. Chasing perfection - No indicator works 100% of the time

## Implementation Examples

**For Trend Following**
"Buy when 20-day MA crosses above 50-day MA. Sell on opposite cross."

**For Mean Reversion**
"Buy when RSI below 30 and price touches lower Bollinger Band."

**For Momentum**
"Buy when MACD turns bullish and price breaks 20-day high."

**For Risk Management**
"Use 2 ATR for stop loss on all trades. Take profits at 3 ATR."
