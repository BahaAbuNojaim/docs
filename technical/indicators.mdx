## Essential Trading Indicators Every Investor Should Know

Professional traders rely on these time-tested indicators to make profitable decisions. Now you can automate them all with eZorro.

### Moving Averages - The Foundation

**What They Show**: The average stock price over a specific time period, smoothing out daily noise to reveal true trends.

**Types of Moving Averages**:

**Simple Moving Average (SMA)**
- 20-day SMA: Short-term trend (1 month)
- 50-day SMA: Medium-term trend (2.5 months)
- 200-day SMA: Long-term trend (10 months)

**Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**
- Reacts faster to recent price changes
- Better for short-term trading
- Common periods: 12-day and 26-day

**How to Trade With Moving Averages**:
- **Golden Cross**: 50-day crosses above 200-day = Major Buy Signal
- **Death Cross**: 50-day crosses below 200-day = Major Sell Signal
- **Price Above MA**: Uptrend confirmed
- **Price Below MA**: Downtrend confirmed

*"Buy stocks when their 20-day moving average crosses above the 50-day moving average. Sell when it crosses below."*

**Success Rate**: 65-70% in trending markets

### RSI - Relative Strength Index

**What It Shows**: Whether a stock is overbought or oversold on a scale of 0-100.

**Key RSI Levels**:
- **Above 70**: Overbought (potential sell signal)
- **Below 30**: Oversold (potential buy signal)
- **50 Level**: Neutral zone

**Professional RSI Strategies**:

**Oversold Bounce**
- Wait for RSI below 30
- Buy when RSI turns up
- Sell when RSI reaches 50-60

**Divergence Trading**
- Stock makes new high but RSI doesn't = Sell signal
- Stock makes new low but RSI doesn't = Buy signal

<Tip>
**Hidden Secret**: RSI works best in ranging markets. In strong trends, use 80/20 levels instead of 70/30.
</Tip>

### MACD - Moving Average Convergence Divergence

**What It Shows**: The relationship between two moving averages, revealing momentum changes.

**MACD Components**:
- **MACD Line**: 12-day EMA minus 26-day EMA
- **Signal Line**: 9-day EMA of MACD line
- **Histogram**: Distance between MACD and Signal lines

**Trading Signals**:
- **Bullish**: MACD crosses above Signal line
- **Bearish**: MACD crosses below Signal line
- **Strong Trend**: Lines far apart
- **Trend Weakening**: Lines converging

**Tell eZorro AI**: 
*"Buy when MACD turns bullish and sell when it turns bearish. Only trade when histogram is expanding."*

### Bollinger Bands

**What They Show**: Dynamic support and resistance levels based on volatility.

**Band Components**:
- **Middle Band**: 20-day moving average
- **Upper Band**: Middle + (2 × standard deviation)
- **Lower Band**: Middle - (2 × standard deviation)

**Trading Strategies**:

**Mean Reversion**
- Buy when price touches lower band
- Sell when price reaches middle or upper band
- Works in sideways markets

**Breakout Trading**
- Buy when price breaks above upper band with volume
- Indicates start of strong trend
- Set stop below middle band

<Warning>
**Important**: 95% of price action occurs within the bands. Moves outside bands are significant!
</Warning>

## Advanced Indicators for Serious Traders

### Stochastic Oscillator

**What It Shows**: Where current price sits relative to recent price range.

**Key Levels**:
- Above 80: Overbought zone
- Below 20: Oversold zone
- 50: Neutral momentum

**Best Used With**: RSI for confirmation of oversold/overbought conditions.

### Average True Range (ATR)

**What It Shows**: Market volatility - how much a stock typically moves.

**How Traders Use ATR**:
- **Position Sizing**: Smaller positions in volatile stocks
- **Stop Loss Placement**: Set stops at 2× ATR from entry
- **Profit Targets**: Target gains of 3× ATR

**Tell eZorro AI**: 
*"Use ATR to set stop losses. Place stops 2 ATR below entry price."*

### Volume Indicators

**On-Balance Volume (OBV)**
- Rising OBV + Rising Price = Healthy uptrend
- Falling OBV + Rising Price = Weak rally (sell signal)

**Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)**
- Price above VWAP = Bullish
- Price below VWAP = Bearish
- Institutions use VWAP as fair value

## Combining Indicators for Maximum Profit

The most profitable strategies combine multiple indicators for confirmation.

### The Triple Confirmation Strategy

**Requirements for Buy Signal**:
1. Price above 50-day moving average (trend)
2. RSI between 40-60 (not overbought)
3. MACD turning bullish (momentum)

**Tell eZorro AI**: 
*"Only buy when price is above 50-day MA, RSI is below 60, and MACD is bullish. Use 2% position size."*

**Expected Performance**:
- Win Rate: 75-80%
- Average Gain: 8-12% per trade
- Fewer trades but higher quality

### The Volatility Breakout System

**Combines**:
- Bollinger Bands (volatility)
- Volume (confirmation)
- ATR (position sizing)

**Tell eZorro AI**: 
*"Buy when price breaks above Bollinger Bands with 2× average volume. Size positions based on ATR. Trail stop at lower band."*

## Indicator Settings for Different Markets

### Trending Markets

**Best Indicators**:
- Moving Average Crossovers
- MACD
- ADX (Above 25 confirms trend)

**Settings**: Use longer periods (50/200 MA instead of 20/50)

### Ranging Markets

**Best Indicators**:
- RSI
- Stochastic
- Bollinger Bands

**Settings**: Use standard periods (14-day RSI, 20-day Bollinger)

### Volatile Markets

**Best Indicators**:
- ATR for risk management
- Bollinger Bands (widen in volatility)
- Volume indicators

**Settings**: Shorter periods for faster reaction

## Common Indicator Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
**Expensive Mistakes Traders Make**:

1. **Using too many indicators** - More isn't better, 3-4 maximum
2. **Ignoring the trend** - Don't buy oversold in downtrends
3. **Not waiting for confirmation** - One indicator alone isn't enough
4. **Wrong timeframe** - Day trading with monthly indicators fails
5. **Chasing perfection** - No indicator works 100% of the time
</Warning>
