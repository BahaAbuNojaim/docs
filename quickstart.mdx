## Strategy Creation

### Conversational Interface

Click "Create New Strategy" to begin a natural language conversation with the AI assistant.

**Example Interaction:**

**User:** "I want to buy Apple when it drops to $150"

**AI:** "Should I place an actual buy order at $150, or alert you when Apple reaches that price? Also, how much would you like to invest?"

**User:** "Alert me first, and I want to invest $1,000"

The AI processes your request and generates appropriate strategy parameters.

### AI Assistance Features

The AI trading assistant provides:

- **Risk Assessment** - Identifies potential risks and suggests protective measures
- **Strategy Optimization** - Recommends technical indicators and timing improvements
- **Clear Explanations** - Translates complex trading concepts into simple terms
- **Error Prevention** - Validates strategy logic before implementation

## Strategy Deployment

### Review and Confirmation

1. **Strategy Review** - Review the AI-generated strategy parameters in plain English
2. **Risk Assessment** - Confirm position sizing and risk management settings
3. **Approval** - Authorize the strategy for deployment
4. **Scheduling** - Set activation time (immediate or scheduled)

### Strategy Summary Example

```
Strategy Configuration:
Investment Amount: $1,000
Action: Alert when Apple stock reaches $150
Risk Management: Stop monitoring if price drops below $140
Duration: 30 days or until manually stopped
