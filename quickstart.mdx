### Step 2: Chat with the AI Agent 🧠

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="comments" title="Start a conversation with the AI">
    Click **"Create New Strategy"** and start chatting with our AI agent in natural language:
    
    **💬 Example conversation:**
    
    **You:** *"I want to buy **AAPL** when it drops to **$150** and sell if it goes above **$180**"*
    
    **AI Agent:** *"I understand you want to buy AAPL at $150 and sell at $180. Would you like me to set up alerts for these price levels, or should I create limit orders? Also, what's your risk tolerance and position size?"*
    
    **You:** *"Set up alerts and use limit orders. I want to risk 2% of my portfolio."*
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="check-circle" title="AI refines and validates your strategy">
    The AI agent will:

    ✅ **Ask clarifying questions** to ensure completeness  
    📊 **Validate** all parameters and conditions  
    🎯 **Use only supported variables** (RSI, MACD, moving averages, volume, etc.)  
    💡 **Suggest improvements** based on your risk tolerance  

    <Tip>🧠 The AI ensures your strategy is **complete** and **executable** before finalizing!</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Schedule Your Strategy 📅

<Accordion icon="calendar-check" title="Confirm and schedule automated execution">
  Once your strategy is complete and validated by the AI:
  
  1. **✅ Review Final Strategy** - The AI presents your completed strategy in plain language
  2. **🎯 Confirm Details** - Verify all conditions, prices, and risk parameters  
  3. **📅 Schedule Execution** - Choose when your strategy should start running
  4. **⚡ Go Live** - Your strategy begins monitoring markets and executing trades automatically
  
  **🎨 Example Final Strategy:**
  *"Alert me when **AAPL** current price equals **$150.00**. Place a limit buy order for AAPL at **$150.00** when this happens. Risk **2%** of portfolio per trade."*
