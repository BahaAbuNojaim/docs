### Step 1: Access the eZorro Platform

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="user-plus" title="Create your account">
    Visit [platform.ezorro.app](https://platform.ezorro.app) and sign up for a free account. You'll get immediate access to the AI assistant and paper trading environment.

### Step 2: Create your first strategy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="brain" title="Describe your strategy idea">
    Use natural language to describe your trading concept to the AI assistant:
    
    *"I want to buy stocks when their 20-day moving average crosses above the 50-day moving average, and sell when it crosses below. Only trade stocks with volume above 1 million shares."*
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="code" title="Review generated algorithm">
    The AI will convert your description into a complete trading algorithm:

    1. Review the generated strategy logic
    2. Adjust parameters like position size, stop losses, and timeframes
    3. Add additional filters or conditions as needed

    <Tip>The AI explains each part of the algorithm in plain English!</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Backtest and deploy

<Accordion icon="chart-bar" title="Run historical backtests">
  1. Select your backtesting timeframe (1 year recommended for first test)
  2. Choose your asset universe (S&P 500, NASDAQ, etc.)
