## 🧠 Conversational AI Approach

Unlike traditional strategy builders, eZorro uses an **intelligent conversational agent** that works with you iteratively to create perfect strategies.

### 💬 How Conversations Work

<Steps>
<Step title="🎯 Start the Conversation">

Navigate to your eZorro dashboard and click **"Create New Strategy"** to start chatting with the AI agent:

**🎨 Example Opening:**
*"I want to buy **AAPL** when it drops below **$150** and sell when it hits **$180**"*
</Step>

<Step title="❓ AI Asks Clarifying Questions">

The AI agent will ask follow-up questions to ensure completeness:

**🤖 AI Response:**
*"I understand you want to trade AAPL between $150-$180. A few questions: 1) Should I set up alerts or place actual orders? 2) What's your position size? 3) Do you want a stop loss below $150?"*

**🎯 Your Response:**
*"Set up limit orders. Use 5% of my portfolio. Yes, stop loss at $145."*
</Step>

<Step title="✅ Confirm Final Strategy">

The AI presents your complete strategy for confirmation:

**🤖 Final Proposal:**
*"Here's your strategy: Place limit buy order for AAPL at $150. Place limit sell order at $180. Set stop loss at $145. Use 5% position sizing. Is this correct?"*

**✅ Your Confirmation:** *"Perfect! Let's do it."*

**🚀 Result**: Strategy is ready for scheduling and execution!
</Step>
</Steps>

## Strategy Components

The AI breaks down your strategy into key components:

### Entry Signals
Conditions that trigger position opening:
- Technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, MACD)
- Fundamental filters (market cap, volume, sector)
- Market conditions (volatility, trend strength)

### Exit Rules
Automated position management:
- Stop losses for risk management
- Take profit levels for securing gains
- Time-based exits for holding period limits

### Risk Management
Built-in controls to protect capital:
- Position sizing based on volatility
- Portfolio concentration limits
- Maximum drawdown controls

## Natural Language Examples

Here are effective ways to describe different strategy types:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mean Reversion Strategy">
    "Buy stocks when they fall more than 10% below their 20-day average, but only if the overall market (SPY) is in an uptrend. Sell when the stock recovers to its 20-day average or after holding for 5 days maximum."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Breakout Strategy">
    "Trade stocks that break above their 52-week high on volume at least 2x their average. Enter long positions and set stops at 5% below entry. Exit when momentum slows (RSI drops below 70)."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sector Rotation">
    "Rotate between technology and healthcare ETFs based on their relative strength. Invest in the sector with better 3-month performance vs SPY. Rebalance monthly and limit sector allocation to 50% of portfolio."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Start simple**: Begin with basic strategies before adding complex conditions. The AI can always help you enhance strategies iteratively.
</Tip>

- Be specific about timeframes (daily, weekly, intraday)
- Include risk management in your initial description
- Mention any asset class preferences or restrictions
- Specify your preferred backtesting period

<Warning>
  **Avoid overfitting**: Don't create strategies with too many specific conditions that only work in historical backtests.
</Warning>
