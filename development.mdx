  - Customizing and refining your strategies
</Info>

The eZorro AI Strategy Builder transforms your trading ideas into executable algorithms using advanced natural language processing.

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the AI Assistant">

Navigate to the AI Strategy Builder in your eZorro platform:

```
https://platform.ezorro.app/assistant
```
</Step>

<Step title="Describe your trading idea">

Use natural language to describe your strategy. Be specific about:

- **Entry conditions**: When to buy/sell
- **Exit conditions**: When to close positions  
- **Asset selection**: What to trade
- **Risk parameters**: Position sizing, stop losses

**Example prompt:**
```text
Create a momentum strategy that buys stocks when their 20-day moving average crosses above the 50-day moving average. Only trade stocks with daily volume above 1 million shares and market cap above $1 billion. Set a 2% stop loss and take profits at 8% gain.
```

</Step>

<Step title="Review and customize">

The AI will generate a complete strategy with:
- Entry/exit logic
- Risk management rules
- Position sizing calculations
- Backtesting parameters

Review the generated code and make adjustments as needed.

</Steps>

## Strategy Components

The AI breaks down your strategy into key components:

### Entry Signals
Conditions that trigger position opening:
- Technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, MACD)
- Fundamental filters (market cap, volume, sector)
- Market conditions (volatility, trend strength)

### Exit Rules
Automated position management:
- Stop losses for risk management
- Take profit levels for securing gains
- Time-based exits for holding period limits

### Risk Management
Built-in controls to protect capital:
- Position sizing based on volatility
- Portfolio concentration limits
- Maximum drawdown controls

## Natural Language Examples

Here are effective ways to describe different strategy types:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mean Reversion Strategy">
    "Buy stocks when they fall more than 10% below their 20-day average, but only if the overall market (SPY) is in an uptrend. Sell when the stock recovers to its 20-day average or after holding for 5 days maximum."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Breakout Strategy">
    "Trade stocks that break above their 52-week high on volume at least 2x their average. Enter long positions and set stops at 5% below entry. Exit when momentum slows (RSI drops below 70)."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sector Rotation">
    "Rotate between technology and healthcare ETFs based on their relative strength. Invest in the sector with better 3-month performance vs SPY. Rebalance monthly and limit sector allocation to 50% of portfolio."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Start simple**: Begin with basic strategies before adding complex conditions. The AI can always help you enhance strategies iteratively.
</Tip>

- Be specific about timeframes (daily, weekly, intraday)
- Include risk management in your initial description
- Mention any asset class preferences or restrictions
- Specify your preferred backtesting period

<Warning>
  **Avoid overfitting**: Don't create strategies with too many specific conditions that only work in historical backtests.
</Warning>
