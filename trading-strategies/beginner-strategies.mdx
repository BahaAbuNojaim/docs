## Best Strategies for New Traders

These simple but effective strategies have helped thousands of beginners start profitable automated trading.

### Strategy 1: Buy the Dip

**Perfect for:** Long-term investors who want to buy quality stocks on sale

**How it works:** When a good stock drops below its average price, automatically buy it. When it recovers, take your profits.

**Example implementation:** Buy Apple when it drops 5% below its 20-day average price. Sell when it goes back to the average price.

**Why it works:**
- Quality stocks typically recover from temporary dips
- Systematic approach to buying low and selling high  
- Performs well in bull markets
- Low risk when applied to blue-chip stocks

**Implementation with eZorro AI:** "I want to buy Apple when it drops 5% below its 20-day moving average and sell when it recovers to the average."

**Expected results:** 15-25% annual returns with large-cap stocks

### Strategy 2: Momentum Breakout

**Perfect for:** Traders who want to catch stocks when they start moving up with strong momentum

**How it works:** When a stock breaks above its recent high prices with high trading volume, enter the position to ride the momentum.

**Example implementation:** Buy Tesla when it goes above its 30-day high and volume is 50% higher than normal. Sell after 10% gain or 5% loss.

**Why it works:**
- Captures stocks at the beginning of major moves
- High volume confirms genuine breakouts rather than false signals
- Quick profits when the strategy succeeds
- Clear stop-loss limits downside risk

**Implementation with eZorro AI:** "Buy Tesla when it breaks above its 30-day high with high volume. Take 10% profits or cut losses at 5%."

**Expected results:** 60-70% win rate, average 8% per winning trade

### Strategy 3: Dividend Collector

**Perfect for:** Conservative investors who want steady income plus capital appreciation

**How it works:** Buy dividend-paying stocks when they become temporarily undervalued, collect dividends during the holding period, then sell if they become overpriced or reach profit targets.

**Example implementation:** Buy Coca-Cola when dividend yield goes above 3.5%. Hold until yield drops below 2.5% or take 20% profits.

**Why it works:**
- Dividend stocks tend to be more stable
- Generate income while waiting for price appreciation
- Mean reversion principle - prices tend to return to normal levels
- Lower volatility provides more predictable returns

**Implementation with eZorro AI:** "Buy dividend stocks when they yield above 3.5% and sell when yield drops below 2.5% or I have 20% gains."

**Expected results:** 8-12% annual returns plus 3-4% dividend income

## Beginner Strategy Success Guidelines

### Best Practices

**Start small:** Begin with $500-1000 per strategy until you see consistent profits. Then gradually increase your investment amounts.

**Focus on one strategy:** Master one strategy first before trying others. Become proficient at one approach rather than spreading yourself too thin.

**Track performance:** Monitor your results weekly. eZorro provides detailed analytics showing exactly how much each strategy is making or losing.

**Use AI safety features:** When the AI suggests stop-losses or position sizing rules, implement them - they protect your capital.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Don't risk more than 5% per trade** - Even the best strategies experience losses
- **Don't abandon strategies after one bad trade** - Give each strategy at least 3 months to demonstrate effectiveness  
- **Don't ignore stop-losses** - They prevent small losses from becoming large ones
- **Don't trade penny stocks** - Focus on quality companies priced above $20 per share
