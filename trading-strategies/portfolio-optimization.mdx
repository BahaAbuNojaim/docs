The "Holy Grail" of investing - finding the perfect balance between risk and return.

## Modern Portfolio Theory Made Simple

No PhD required - eZorro handles the complex math while you focus on your investment goals.

### Diversification That Actually Works

**Beyond Basic Diversification**: It's not about how many stocks you own, but how they work together.

**Smart Diversification Example**:

- Utility stock (stability)
- International stock (geographic diversity)
- Bonds (safety)
- Commodities (inflation protection)

Each component serves a specific purpose and balances the others.

## Risk Parity Approach

The secret weapon of hedge funds - now yours with eZorro.

### Equal Risk Contribution

Instead of equal dollars, allocate so each holding contributes equally to portfolio risk.

**Traditional Portfolio** (Equal Weight):
- Stocks: 50% of money, 90% of risk
- Bonds: 50% of money, 10% of risk

**Risk Parity Portfolio**:
- Stocks: 25% of money, 50% of risk
- Bonds: 75% of money, 50% of risk

**Result**: Same returns, 40% less volatility!

**Tell eZorro AI**: 
*"Create risk parity portfolio. Each asset should contribute equally to total risk. Use leverage on bonds if needed."*

## Tax-Optimized Portfolio Management

Keep more of what you earn with intelligent tax strategies.

### Tax Loss Harvesting

**Automated tax savings**: Sell losers to offset gains

**Tell eZorro AI**: 
*"Harvest tax losses when positions drop 10%. Replace with similar but not identical assets to maintain exposure."*

**Annual Tax Savings**: $3,000+ for most investors

### Asset Location Optimization

**Put the right assets in the right accounts**:
- Tax-inefficient assets (bonds, REITs) → IRA/401k
- Tax-efficient assets (index funds) → Taxable account
- High-growth assets → Roth IRA

**Tell eZorro AI**: 
*"Optimize asset location across my taxable and IRA accounts. Minimize total tax burden."*

## Common Portfolio Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
**Expensive Mistakes**:

1. **Over-diversification** - 100 stocks isn't better than 20-30 well-chosen ones
2. **Home bias** - Don't put 90% in US stocks just because you live here
3. **Recency bias** - Last year's winner often becomes this year's loser
4. **Ignoring costs** - High fees destroy optimized returns
5. **Set and forget** - Markets change, portfolios must adapt
</Warning>
