## The Golden Rules

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="2% Rule" icon="percentage">

  </Card>
  
  <Card title="6% Portfolio Heat" icon="fire">
    Never have more than 6% total risk across all open positions. Prevents overexposure during active periods.
  </Card>

## How Risk Management Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Calculate Position Size">
    Determine how many shares to buy based on your risk percentage and stop-loss distance. Never exceed your risk limits.

  <Step title="Set Stop Losses">
    Always use stop losses on every trade. Choose between percentage-based, ATR-based, or trailing stops.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Portfolio Heat">
    Track total risk across all positions. Reduce exposure when limits are approached.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Account Size Guidelines

<Steps>
  <Step title="Small Accounts ($1,000-$10,000)">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Medium Accounts ($10,000-$100,000)">
    Balanced approach: 1-1.5% per trade, 5-8 positions, begin sector diversification.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Large Accounts ($100,000+)">
    Professional management: 0.5-1% per trade, 10-15 positions, multiple strategies.
  </Step>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Removing Stop Losses" icon="x">
    Never remove stops hoping "it will come back." This causes more failures than any other mistake.

  <Card title="Averaging Down" icon="arrow-down">
    Don't add to losing positions. This multiplies risk exponentially instead of reducing it.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Revenge Trading" icon="angry">
    Attempting to recover losses quickly leads to even larger losses and emotional decisions.

  <Card title="Ignoring Correlation" icon="link">
