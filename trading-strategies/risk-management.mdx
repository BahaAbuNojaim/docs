</Steps>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Medium Accounts ($10,000–$100,000)">
    Balanced approach: 1–1.5% per trade, greater diversification across sectors.

  <Step title="Large Accounts ($100,000+)">
    Use tighter risk controls: 0.5–1% per trade, more positions, and multi-strategy allocation.
  </Step>
</Steps>
