The difference between successful traders and unsuccessful ones is consistent risk management. Learn how to protect your capital while maximizing long-term profitability.

## The Golden Rules of Trading Risk Management

Professional traders follow these rules systematically. Now you can automate them with eZorro to remove emotional decision-making from the process.

### Rule 1: The 2% Rule

**Never risk more than 2% of your account on any single trade**

This means if you have $10,000, the maximum you should risk per trade is $200. This ensures you can survive extended losing streaks without significant portfolio damage.

**eZorro AI implementation:** "Always limit my risk to 2% of my account balance per trade. Adjust position sizes automatically."

### Rule 2: The 6% Portfolio Heat Rule

**Never have more than 6% total risk across all open positions**

If you have 5 open trades, each should risk less than 1.2% to stay under the 6% total limit. This prevents overexposure during periods of high activity.

**eZorro AI implementation:** "Limit total portfolio risk to 6%. Don't open new trades if it would exceed this limit."

### Rule 3: The Risk-Reward Ratio

**Only take trades with at least 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio**

If you risk $100, you should potentially make at least $200. This ensures profitability even with moderate win rates.

**Mathematical advantage:** With a 2:1 risk-reward ratio, you remain profitable with just a 40% win rate. At 50% win rate, you become very profitable. At 60% win rate, you achieve exceptional returns. This is why professionals focus on risk-reward ratios rather than just win rates.

## Position Sizing Strategies

Proper position sizing is the foundation of professional risk management.

### Fixed Percentage Method

**Most popular and safest approach for consistent risk management**

**Implementation:** Risk the same percentage of your account on every trade, regardless of the specific setup or market conditions.

**eZorro AI implementation:** "Use 1% risk per trade. Calculate position size based on the distance to my stop loss."

**Example calculation:**
- Account balance: $10,000
- Risk per trade: 1% = $100
- Stop loss distance: $2 per share
- Position size: $100 รท $2 = 50 shares

### Volatility-Based Sizing

**Adjusts position size based on current market conditions**

**Method:** Take smaller positions in volatile markets, larger positions in stable markets to maintain consistent risk levels.

**eZorro AI implementation:** "Adjust position sizes based on ATR (Average True Range). Use smaller sizes when volatility is high."

**Benefits:**
- Maintains consistent risk regardless of market conditions
- Automatically reduces exposure during uncertain periods
- Maximizes profit potential during stable trending periods

## Stop Loss Strategies

Stop losses are your primary defense against large losses. Use them on every single trade without exception.

### Percentage-Based Stops

**Simple and effective approach for most traders**

**eZorro AI implementation:** "Set stop loss at 5% below my entry price for all stock trades."

**Best applications:**
- Long-term investment strategies
- Blue-chip stock trading
- Low-volatility market environments

### ATR-Based Stops

**Professional approach that adapts to market volatility**

**eZorro AI implementation:** "Set stop loss at 2x ATR below entry price. Adjust daily based on current volatility."

**Advantages:**
- Prevents premature exits due to normal market fluctuations
- Tightens stops during calm market periods
- Provides appropriate room during volatile periods

### Trailing Stops

**Lock in profits while allowing winning trades to continue**

**eZorro AI implementation:** "Use a 10% trailing stop. Move it up as the stock rises but never move it down."

**Optimal use cases:**
- Trend-following strategies
- Momentum-based trades
- Maximizing profits on significant winners

**Professional technique:** Combine trailing stops with profit targets. Take partial profits at 10% gain, then trail the remaining position for larger profits.

## Portfolio-Level Risk Controls

Think beyond individual trades to protect your entire investment portfolio.

### Correlation Management

**Avoid concentration in assets that move together**

**Common problem:** Buying Apple, Microsoft, and Google may seem diversified, but technology stocks often move in tandem.

**Solution - eZorro AI implementation:** "Limit correlation between positions to 0.6. Don't let me buy stocks that move together."

### Sector Concentration Limits

**Spread risk across different industries and market segments**

**eZorro AI implementation:** "Maximum 20% of portfolio in any single sector. Maximum 5 positions in technology stocks."

**Risk reduction benefits:**
- Protection against sector-specific downturns
- Enforces genuine diversification
- Reduces overall portfolio volatility

### Maximum Drawdown Protection

**The ultimate portfolio safety mechanism**

**eZorro AI implementation:** "If portfolio drops 10% from its peak, stop all trading and alert me. Resume only after my approval."

**Protective benefits:**
- Prevents emotional trading during difficult periods
- Forces systematic strategy review during drawdowns
- Guards against system or strategy failures

## Risk Management for Different Account Sizes

### Small Accounts ($1,000 - $10,000)

**Special considerations:**
- Focus on percentage risk rather than dollar amounts
- Trade fewer positions with proper sizing
- Avoid excessive diversification that dilutes returns

**Recommended framework:**
- 2% risk per trade maximum
- 3-4 open positions maximum
- Minimum position size: $500

### Medium Accounts ($10,000 - $100,000)

**Optimal approach:**
- 1-1.5% risk per trade
- 5-8 open positions maximum
- Sector diversification becomes important
- Begin incorporating multiple strategies

### Large Accounts ($100,000+)

**Professional management approach:**
- 0.5-1% risk per trade
- 10-15 positions for proper diversification
- Multiple strategy allocation
- Consider market-neutral approaches

## Common Risk Management Mistakes

Learn from these expensive errors made by other traders:

**Critical mistakes to avoid:**

1. **Removing stop losses** - The phrase "it will come back" has caused more trading failures than any other mindset
2. **Averaging down** - Adding to losing positions multiplies risk exponentially
3. **Revenge trading** - Attempting to recover losses leads to larger losses
4. **Ignoring correlation** - Having 10 positions that move together provides no diversification
5. **Position size gambling** - Increasing size after wins typically leads to giving back all gains

## Building Your Risk Management Plan

Create your personalized risk framework with eZorro:

### Step 1: Define Your Risk Tolerance

**Moderate approach:** "Risk up to 2% per trade. Maximum 6% portfolio heat."

Configure eZorro AI with your non-negotiable risk parameters:
- Maximum daily loss limit

## The Psychology of Risk Management

Understanding why risk management is psychologically difficult helps you maintain discipline.

### Why Traders Ignore Risk Rules

1. **Greed** - Desire for larger profits leads to oversized positions
2. **Fear** - Afraid of missing opportunities causes poor decisions
3. **Hope** - Holding losing positions hoping for recovery
4. **Ego** - Difficulty admitting when analysis is wrong
