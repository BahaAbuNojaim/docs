**The difference between successful traders and broke traders** is risk management. Learn how to protect your capital while maximizing profits.

## The Golden Rules of Trading Risk Management

Professional traders follow these rules religiously. Now you can automate them with eZorro.

### Rule #1: The 2% Rule

**Never risk more than 2% of your account on any single trade**

This means if you have $10,000, the maximum you should risk per trade is $200. This ensures you can survive losing streaks.

**Tell eZorro AI**: 
*"Always limit my risk to 2% of my account balance per trade. Adjust position sizes automatically."*

### Rule #2: The 6% Portfolio Heat Rule

**Never have more than 6% total risk across all open positions**

If you have 5 open trades, each should risk less than 1.2% to stay under the 6% total limit.

**Tell eZorro AI**: 
*"Limit total portfolio risk to 6%. Don't open new trades if it would exceed this limit."*

### Rule #3: The Risk-Reward Ratio

**Only take trades with at least 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio**

If you risk $100, you should potentially make at least $200. This ensures you're profitable even with a 40% win rate.

<Card title="Quick Math for Success" icon="calculator">
With 2:1 risk-reward ratio:
- 40% win rate = Profitable
- 50% win rate = Very profitable  
- 60% win rate = Exceptional returns

This is why professionals focus on risk-reward, not just win rate.

## Position Sizing Strategies

Proper position sizing is the secret weapon of professional traders.

### Fixed Percentage Method

**Most popular and safest approach**

**How it works**: Risk the same percentage of your account on every trade, regardless of the setup.

**Tell eZorro AI**: 
*"Use 1% risk per trade. Calculate position size based on the distance to my stop loss."*

**Example**: 
- Account: $10,000
- Risk per trade: 1% = $100
- Stop loss distance: $2
- Position size: $100 รท $2 = 50 shares

### Volatility-Based Sizing

**Adjusts position size based on market conditions**

**How it works**: Take smaller positions in volatile markets, larger positions in calm markets.

**Tell eZorro AI**: 
*"Adjust position sizes based on ATR (Average True Range). Use smaller sizes when volatility is high."*

**Benefits**:
- Consistent risk regardless of market conditions
- Automatically reduces exposure during uncertain times
- Maximizes profits during stable trends

## Stop Loss Strategies

Stop losses are your safety net. Use them on every single trade.

### Percentage-Based Stops

**Simple and effective for beginners**

**Tell eZorro AI**: 
*"Set stop loss at 5% below my entry price for all stock trades."*

**When to use**:
- Long-term investing
- Blue-chip stocks
- Low-volatility markets

### ATR-Based Stops

**Professional approach that adapts to volatility**

**Tell eZorro AI**: 
*"Set stop loss at 2x ATR below entry price. Adjust daily based on volatility."*

**Advantages**:
- Prevents getting stopped out by normal fluctuations
- Tightens during calm markets
- Loosens during volatile periods

### Trailing Stops

**Lock in profits while letting winners run**

**Tell eZorro AI**: 
*"Use a 10% trailing stop. Move it up as the stock rises but never move it down."*

**Perfect for**:
- Trend-following strategies
- Momentum trades
- Maximizing profits on big winners

<Tip>
**Pro Secret**: Combine trailing stops with profit targets. Take half your position at 10% gain, then trail the rest for bigger profits.
</Tip>

## Portfolio-Level Risk Controls

Think beyond individual trades to protect your entire portfolio.

### Correlation Management

**Don't put all eggs in similar baskets**

**Problem**: Buying Apple, Microsoft, and Google seems diversified, but they often move together.

**Solution - Tell eZorro AI**: 
*"Limit correlation between positions to 0.6. Don't let me buy stocks that move together."*

### Sector Concentration Limits

**Spread risk across different industries**

**Tell eZorro AI**: 
*"Maximum 20% of portfolio in any single sector. Maximum 5 positions in technology stocks."*

**Why this matters**:
- Protects against sector-specific crashes
- Forces true diversification
- Reduces portfolio volatility

### Maximum Drawdown Protection

**The ultimate portfolio safety net**

**Tell eZorro AI**: 
*"If portfolio drops 10% from its peak, stop all trading and alert me. Resume only after my approval."*

**Benefits**:
- Prevents emotional trading during drawdowns
- Forces strategy review during tough times
- Protects against system failures

## Risk Management for Different Account Sizes

### Small Accounts ($1,000 - $10,000)

**Special considerations**:
- Focus on percentage risk, not dollar amounts
- Trade fewer positions with proper sizing
- Avoid over-diversification

**Recommended Setup**:
- 2% risk per trade
- Maximum 3-4 open positions
- Minimum position size: $500

### Medium Accounts ($10,000 - $100,000)

**Optimal approach**:
- 1-1.5% risk per trade
- 5-8 open positions maximum
- Sector diversification becomes important

### Large Accounts ($100,000+)

**Professional management**:
- 0.5-1% risk per trade
- 10-15 positions for diversification
- Multiple strategy allocation
- Consider market-neutral approaches

## Common Risk Management Mistakes

Learn from others' expensive mistakes:

<Warning>
**Deadly Mistakes to Avoid**:

1. **Removing stop losses** - "It will come back" has bankrupted more traders than any other phrase
2. **Averaging down** - Adding to losing positions multiplies risk
3. **Revenge trading** - Trying to "win back" losses leads to bigger losses
4. **Ignoring correlation** - Having 10 positions that all move together isn't diversification
5. **Position size gambling** - Increasing size after wins leads to giving it all back
</Warning>

## The Psychology of Risk

### Why Traders Ignore Risk Rules

1. **Greed** - Wanting bigger profits leads to bigger positions
2. **Fear** - Afraid of missing out causes poor decisions

4. **Ego** - Not admitting when wrong
